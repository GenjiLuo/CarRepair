## Synopsis
Car Repairs Shop (CRS) undertakes car repairs for their customers. A car repair job could
be either a maintenance job or a breakdown repair job. You have been asked to develop a
prototype Java application, using GUI, to maintain the records that are related to car repair jobs
performed by CRS. 

Even though the cost of a part remains the same, the application allows inputting different costs 
for the same part in different jobs. Hence, it is expected that the application should maintain 
the details of parts that are currently available in the shop.
The application should allow the user to enter the details related to new parts and also to
view/modify/save the details related to existing parts (parts-data).

Finally, the program must output the bill to a text file.
## Install
First, make a directory to install the files to and change to that directory using :
```bash
 mkdir car_repair && cd car_repair
```
Then all you need to do is clone the project from github into the directory by using :
```bash
 git clone https://github.com/josh-privata/CarRepair.git
```
## Usage
##### Note:  [Java Runtime](https://java.com/en/download/) is required to run the preceding commands.
Initially the program needs to be compiled. After you have copied the *.java files to a directory, run the command :
```bash
$ javac *.java
```
Then run the program using the command :
```bash
$ java Start
```
